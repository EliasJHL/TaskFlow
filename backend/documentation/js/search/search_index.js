\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

API\n\n The robust, high-performance backend powering the TaskFlow platform.  Built with NestJS, Fastify, and GraphQL. \n\n     \n\n Architecture • Getting Started • Testing • Documentation \n\nArchitecture\nTaskFlow API follows a Modular Monolith architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.\nIt leverages the \"Platform Agnostic\" capability of NestJS by using the Fastify Adapter for maximum performance (up to 2x faster than Express).\nRequest Lifecycle\nExample :graph TD\n    Client[(\"Client\")]\n    \n    subgraph \"Backend Core - NestJS\"\n        Gateway[\"Fastify Adapter\"]\n        Guard[\"Auth & Workspace Guards\"]\n        Interceptor[\"DTO Validation Pipe\"]\n        \n        subgraph \"GraphQL Layer\"\n            Resolver[\"Resolvers\"]\n            FieldResolver[\"Field Resolvers\"]\n        end\n        \n        Service[\"Services - Business Logic\"]\n        Prisma[\"Prisma Client\"]\n    end\n    \n    DB[(\"PostgresQL\")]\n\n    Client --> Gateway\n    Gateway --> Guard\n    Guard --> Interceptor\n    Interceptor --> Resolver\n    \n    Resolver -- \"Main Data\" --> Service\n    Resolver -. \"Nested Data\" .-> FieldResolver\n    \n    Service --> Prisma\n    FieldResolver --> Prisma\n    Prisma --> DBKey Design Patterns\n\nSchema First GraphQL: Type definitions (.graphql files) are the single source of truth. TypeScript definitions are auto-generated.\n\nHybrid Loading Strategy: We optimize performance by avoiding massive SQL joins. The Main Resolver fetches the core entity, while Field Resolvers (@ResolveField) lazily fetch related data (Boards, Lists, Cards) only when requested by the client.\n\nErrors as Data: Mutations do not throw generic exceptions. They return Union Types (e.g., RegisterSuccess | RegisterError) allowing the frontend to handle business errors (like \"Email taken\") as strongly-typed data.\n\nSecure Authentication: Implementation of HttpOnly Cookies preventing XSS attacks on JWT tokens.\n\n\n🛠️ Tech Stack\n\n\n\nComponent\nTechnology\nBenefit\n\n\n\n\nFramework\nNestJS\nStrict architecture, Dependency Injection, Decorators.\n\n\nEngine\nFastify\nHigh performance, low overhead (up to 2x faster than Express).\n\n\nAPI\nGraphQL (Mercurius)\nEfficient Data Fetching, Type Safety, Playground.\n\n\nDatabase\nPostgreSQL + Prisma\nReliability, Type-safe queries, Migrations.\n\n\nTesting\nJest\nUnit and Integration testing with mocking.\n\n\nDoc\nCompodoc\nVisual documentation of the modules graph.\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js (v18 or later)\n\nDocker (for the local Database)\n\nnpm or pnpm\n\n\nInstallation\nClone the repository\nExample :git clone git@github.com:EliasJHL/TaskFlow.git\ncd taskflow/backendInstall dependencies\nExample :npm installEnvironment Setup\nCreate a .env file in the root directory: \nExample :DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/taskflow_db?schema=public\" \nJWT_SECRET=\"your_super_secret_key_change_me\" \nCOOKIE_SECRET=\"another_secret_for_cookies\"\nNODE_ENV=\"development\"\nPORT=3000Database Setup\nStart the database container and apply migrations:\nExample :# 1. Start Docker container\ndocker-compose up -d db\n\n# 2. Push schema to DB (Dev mode)\nnpx prisma db push\n\n# 3. Generate Prisma Client (Vital for TypeScript)\nnpx prisma generate Running the App\nExample :npm run start:devOnce started, the GraphQL Playground is available at: 👉 http://localhost:3000/graphiql\nTesting\nWe maintain a high standard of code quality with 100% coverage on critical paths (Services & Resolvers).\nUnit Tests\nTests are located next to the files they test (*.spec.ts).\nExample :# Run all unit tests\nnpm run test\n\n# Run tests in watch mode (TDD)\nnpm run test:watchCoverage Report\nTo generate the coverage report and verify system integrity:\nExample :npm run test:covDocumentation\nCode Architecture (Compodoc)\nGenerate a static website exploring the modules, services, and dependency graph.\nExample :npm run docThen open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.\nAPI Documentation\nThe API is self-documented via the GraphQL Schema. You can inspect the schema and test queries directly in the Playground at /graphiql.\nExample Query:\nExample :query GetMyDashboard {\n    workspaces {\n        name\n        is_pinned\n        boards {\n            title\n            color\n        }\n    }\n}Project Structure\nExample :src/ \n├── auth/ # Authentication (Login, Register, Guards) \n├── board/ # Board management (Kanban logic) \n├──
